# Spacing

By default, Tailwind includes a generous and comprehensive numeric spacing scale. 
The values are proportional, so 16 is twice as much spacing as 8 for example. One 
spacing unit is equal to 0.25rem, which translates to 4px by default in common browsers.


<Table
  headers={['Name', 'Size', 'Pixel', '']}
  rows={spacing}

/>
