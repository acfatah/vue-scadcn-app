A **PanelMenu** is a type of navigation component that combines elements of both accordion menus and tree menus. It is typically used to display hierarchical data or navigation links in a collapsible, expandable format. 

### Key Features of a PanelMenu:
1. **Collapsible Panels**: Sections of the menu can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide nested items.
2. **Hierarchical Structure**: Allows for multiple levels of nested items, making it suitable for complex navigation structures.
3. **Interactive**: Users can interact with the panels to navigate through different levels of the menu.
4. **Responsive Design**: Can be designed to work well on various screen sizes, often collapsing into more compact forms on smaller devices.

### Use Cases:
- **Side Navigation**: Often used in sidebars for websites or applications to provide a structured way to navigate through different sections.
- **Settings Menus**: Ideal for settings or configuration menus where options are grouped into categories and subcategories.
- **Documentation Sites**: Useful for displaying hierarchical documentation topics and subtopics.

### Example Structure:
```html
<div class="panel-menu">
  <div class="panel">
    <button class="panel-header">Category 1</button>
    <div class="panel-content">
      <ul>
        <li>Subcategory 1.1</li>
        <li>Subcategory 1.2</li>
        <li>Subcategory 1.3</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="panel">
    <button class="panel-header">Category 2</button>
    <div class="panel-content">
      <ul>
        <li>Subcategory 2.1</li>
        <li>Subcategory 2.2</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- Additional panels... -->
</div>
```

### Benefits:
- **Improves Usability**: Organizes complex navigation structures in a clear and user-friendly way.
- **Saves Space**: Collapsible panels help save screen space, showing only the relevant sections the user is interested in.
- **Enhances Organization**: Provides a neat and organized way to display hierarchical data or navigation links.

In summary, a **PanelMenu** is an effective component for displaying hierarchical navigation in a collapsible and expandable format, making it a versatile choice for various applications and websites.
