# Design Tokens

Design tokens are reusable, named values that represent design elements, such as 
colors, typography, spacing, and more. They serve as a single source of truth for 
design decisions, ensuring consistency across different platforms, applications, 
and teams.

In Figma, design tokens are created as a set of named values that can be used 
throughout the design file. These tokens can then be exported and applied to web 
applications, allowing designers and developers to maintain a consistent visual 
language.

Common examples of design tokens include:

* Colors (e.g. primary color, secondary color, background color)
* Typography (e.g. font family, font size, line height)
* Spacing (e.g. margin, padding, gutter)
* Shadows and effects
* Icons and graphics

By using design tokens, teams can:

* Ensure design consistency across different applications and platforms
* Easily update design elements across the entire application
* Improve collaboration between designers and developers
* Reduce design debt and inconsistencies

Design tokens can be implemented in web applications using various methods, such 
as CSS variables, theme objects, or design systems libraries.

## Theming

Our application features two distinct themes: Light and Dark. These themes are 
built on top of our design tokens, ensuring a consistent visual language across 
both modes.

### Light Theme (default)

The Light theme is our default theme, characterized by:

A bright and airy color scheme, with a primary color of #3498db ($primary-color)
A clean and simple typography, with a font family of Open Sans ($font-family)
Ample whitespace and subtle shadows to create a sense of depth

### Dark Theme

The Dark theme is designed for users who prefer a more dramatic and immersive 
experience, featuring:

A rich and bold color scheme, with a primary color of #2ecc71 ($primary-color-dark)
The same clean typography as the Light theme, but with a darker background to 
create high contrast
Deep shadows and subtle gradients to add depth and visual interest

### Shared Design Tokens

Both themes share a common set of design tokens, including:

- Typography (font family, font size, line height)
- Spacing (margin, padding, gutter)
- Icons and graphics
- By using design tokens, we can easily switch between Light and Dark themes, ensuring 
a consistent user experience across both modes.

Theme Switching
Users can switch between Light and Dark themes using a toggle in the application 
settings. The theme switcher uses CSS variables to update the design tokens, allowing 
for a seamless transition between themes.
