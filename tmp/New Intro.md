## Introduction

This boilerplate combines [Vite](https://vite.dev), [Vue](https://vuejs.org), and 
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) with the [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com) 
design system to provide a solid foundation for building a front-end web applications.

### Motivation

While working with large team, I had the challange to build the UI components

> - the problem is not building but the time to build

- Designers from the UI/UX team will work with Figma components specifically tailored
  to the shadcn design system. These components are fully convertible to Vue components,
  ensuring design and development are aligned.

- **Component Driven User Interfaces**: An approach that focuses on building UIs
  using reusable components. This methodology promotes consistency, maintainability,
  and scalability by enabling developers to construct user interfaces from well-defined,
  isolated, and interchangeable components. [Learn more](https://www.componentdriven.org)

- The template includes ready-made common components, so front-end developers can focus
  on functionality rather than reinventing UI elements. This allows for faster development
  of front-end applications, improving efficiency and ensuring design consistency.

- Well documented components using [Component Story Format (CSF)](https://github.com/ComponentDriven/csf)
